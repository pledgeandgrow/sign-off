## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. `contexts/OnboardingContext.tsx` - Manages onboarding state
2. `app/onboarding.tsx` - Onboarding screen component

### Files Modified
1. `app/_layout.tsx` - Added routing logic for onboarding
2. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Removed direct navigation after signup
3. `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added "Revoir l'introduction" option

### State Management
- Uses AsyncStorage to persist onboarding completion status
- Key: `@signoff_onboarding_completed`
- Value: `'true'` when completed, absent when not

### Routing Logic
```
User Authentication Check
    â†“
Not Authenticated â†’ Sign In
    â†“
Authenticated â†’ Check Onboarding Status
    â†“
Not Completed â†’ Onboarding Screen â†’ Home
    â†“
Completed â†’ Home Screen
```

## Reset Onboarding (For Testing)

To reset onboarding status for testing:

```javascript
// In React Native Debugger or via code
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('@signoff_onboarding_completed');
```

Or use the Profile â†’ "Revoir l'introduction" option which resets and shows it again.

## Console Logs

The app logs routing decisions:
- `ðŸŽ“ Redirecting to onboarding...` - User needs to see onboarding
- `âœ… Onboarding completed, redirecting to home...` - User completed onboarding

Monitor these logs to debug routing issues.
