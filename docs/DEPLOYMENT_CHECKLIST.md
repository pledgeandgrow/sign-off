   - [ ] Execute query
   - [ ] Verify no errors in output

3. **Verify Execution**
   ```sql
   -- Check table count
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN (
     'users', 'private_key_recovery', 'vaults', 'vault_items',
     'inheritance_plans', 'heirs', 'heir_vault_access',
     'user_activity', 'inheritance_triggers', 'shared_vaults',
     'audit_logs', 'security_alerts', 'password_breach_checks',
     'two_factor_auth', 'user_sessions'
   );
   -- Should return 15
   ```
   - [ ] 15 tables created

FROM pg_type t 
JOIN pg_enum e ON t.oid = e.enumtypid 
WHERE typname IN (
  'vault_item_type', 'inheritance_plan_type', 'activation_method_type',
  'access_level_type', 'activity_type', 'trigger_reason_type',
  'trigger_status_type', 'alert_type', 'severity_type', 'two_fa_method_type'
)
ORDER BY typname, enumsortorder;
```

FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```
- [ ] All tables have appropriate indexes
- [ ] Total index count is 40+

### Step 5: Verify RLS Policies

GROUP BY schemaname, tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```
