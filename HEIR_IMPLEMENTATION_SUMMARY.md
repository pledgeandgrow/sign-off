## üìä Database Schema Integration

The implementation fully integrates with your existing database schema:

### Tables Used
1. **`inheritance_plans`** - Stores inheritance plan configurations
2. **`heirs`** - Stores heir information (encrypted)
3. **`heir_vault_access`** - Maps vault/item access permissions
4. **`inheritance_triggers`** - Logs trigger events

### Enum Types
- `inheritance_plan_type`
- `activation_method_type`
- `access_level_type`
- `trigger_reason_type`
- `trigger_status_type`

---

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Modern Design
- Clean, professional card-based layouts
- Color-coded status indicators
- Intuitive icons from Ionicons
- Responsive touch interactions
- Loading states and empty states

### User Experience
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Tab-based navigation for complex views
- Modal forms for creating/editing
- Statistics dashboards

### Accessibility
- Clear labels and descriptions
- Readable font sizes
- High contrast colors
- Touch-friendly button sizes

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Centralized business logic in `inheritanceService.ts`
- **Component Composition**: Reusable, modular components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data

### Best Practices
- Async/await for all database operations
- Error handling with try/catch blocks
- Loading states for better UX
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading of detailed data
- Memoization where beneficial
- Minimal re-renders

## üìù Usage Guide

### Creating an Inheritance Plan

```typescript
import { createInheritancePlan } from '@/lib/services/inheritanceService';

const plan = await createInheritancePlan(userId, {
  plan_name: 'My Estate Plan',
  plan_type: 'partial_access',
  activation_method: 'inactivity',
  scheduled_date: null,
  instructions_encrypted: 'Instructions for heirs...',
  is_active: true,
}, userPublicKey);
```

### Adding an Heir

```typescript
import { createHeir } from '@/lib/services/inheritanceService';

const heir = await createHeir(userId, {
  full_name_encrypted: 'John Doe',
  email_encrypted: 'john@example.com',
  phone_encrypted: '+1234567890',
  relationship_encrypted: 'Son',
  access_level: 'partial',
  inheritance_plan_id: planId,
  notify_on_activation: true,
  notification_delay_days: 7,
  is_active: true,
}, userPublicKey);
```

### Granting Vault Access

```typescript
import { grantVaultAccessToHeir } from '@/lib/services/inheritanceService';

await grantVaultAccessToHeir(heirId, vaultId, {
  can_view: true,
  can_export: true,
  can_edit: false,
});
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Install Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-community/datetimepicker
   npm install @react-native-picker/picker
   ```

2. **Update Existing Components**
   - The old `AddHeir.tsx`, `EditHeir.tsx`, and `ListHeirs.tsx` components need to be updated to use the new type definitions
   - Replace field names from `name`, `email`, `phone`, `relationship` to `full_name_encrypted`, `email_encrypted`, etc.

3. **Add Tab Navigation**
   - Add "Inheritance" tab to your tab navigator in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
   - Configure tab icons and labels

4. **Connect to Supabase**
   - Ensure Supabase connection is properly configured
   - Test database operations with real data
   - Verify RLS policies are working correctly

### Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Implement automated email notifications to heirs
   - Send reminders and status updates

2. **Inactivity Monitoring**
   - Create background job to monitor user inactivity
   - Automatically trigger plans based on inactivity threshold

3. **Death Certificate Verification**
   - Implement document upload functionality
   - Add verification workflow

4. **Heir Portal**
   - Create dedicated interface for heirs to view their inheritance
   - Implement acceptance workflow

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-factor verification for triggers
   - Blockchain integration for immutable records
   - Legal document templates
   - Secure heir messaging

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes Needed

### 1. Old Heir Components
The existing heir components (`AddHeir.tsx`, `EditHeir.tsx`, `ListHeirs.tsx`) use the old type structure. They need to be updated to match the new encrypted field names:

**Old:**
```typescript
name, email, phone, relationship
```

**New:**
```typescript
full_name_encrypted, email_encrypted, phone_encrypted, relationship_encrypted
```

### 2. Missing Dependencies
The `InheritancePlanForm.tsx` uses `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` which needs to be installed.

### 3. Encryption Implementation
The encryption/decryption functions in `lib/encryption.ts` need to be verified and tested with the heir data encryption.

### 4. Private Key Management
The current implementation uses placeholder empty strings for private keys. You need to implement proper key management:
- Store private keys securely
- Retrieve keys when needed for decryption
- Handle key rotation
